# Cloud computing
1. Benefits: scalability, cost-efficiency, and accessibility.
  * Automatically scale resources up or down based on demand.
  * Example: E-commerce websites handling traffic surges during sales.
  * Pay only for what you use (pay-as-you-go).
  * Avoid upfront investments in hardware.
  * Access resources and services from anywhere with an internet connection.
  * Enable remote collaboration and global reach.

2. Real-world examples and use cases.
   * Store and analyze patient data securely.
   * Use AI for diagnostics (e.g., detecting anomalies in medical images).
   * Real-time fraud detection and risk analysis.
   * High-frequency trading applications.
   * Personalize customer experiences using big data.
   * Optimize supply chain and inventory management.

4. Overview of popular providers: AWS, Azure, GCP.

5. 
6. Key services: compute, storage, databases, and analytics.
7. Differences between on-premise vs. cloud environments.
8. Core components: virtual machines, containers, and serverless functions.
9. Introduction to regions, availability zones, and redundancy.
10. How cloud pricing works: pay-as-you-go and reserved models.

# Compare services between AWS, GCP, Azure

| Criteria  | Google Cloud | Azure | AWS |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Ease of use  | Simple console interface, easiest to learn for newcomers  | Familiarity for enterprises using Microsoft tools | Better for users with prior cloud experience, robust documentation and training materials |
| Educational resources  | [Google Cloud Skills Boost](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/) for hands on labs  | Free credits for educators/students through [Azure for Education](https://azureforeducation.microsoft.com/en-us/Institutions) | [AWS Educate](https://aws.amazon.com/education/awseducate/), [AWS Academy](https://aws.amazon.com/training/awsacademy/), [AWS Skill Builder](https://skillbuilder.aws/) |

2. [Comparison](https://cloud.google.com/docs/get-started/aws-azure-gcp-service-comparison):
   * Google Cloud: Great for AI/ML, big data analytics, or cloud-native applications like Kubernetes
   * Azure: Ideal for enterprise setups, hybrid cloud, or Microsoft-heavy environments
   * AWS: Wide range of services on a global network of availability zones and regions

3. Recommendation:
   * If not sure which one to start with, start with Google Cloud
